				Circular RNAs have been proved to be a large class of post-transcriptional regulators, decoying microRNAs from their original mRNA targets, among other regulatory functions \cite{mir7}. This documents is a automatic report made by the script circular\_RNA\_design.py. This script is meant to design such a circular sponge against various microRNAs, passed as arguments. The aim of this sponge is to upregulate the expression of the genes for which the level of expression is regulated by those \-microRNAs. While this script is the final step of a workflow relying on the TriplexRNA database \cite{triplex} to select the microRNAs to be targeted, he can also be used alone.

	\section{Distance of cooperativity}

		There is experimental evidences for microRNAs cooperativity in the post-transcriptional repression they exert, provided that their seeds regions are in close proximity [13-35 nucleotides(nt) between the two seed] \cite{distance}. \\ 
Considering this, the script design by default the circular RNA sponge with a distance of 17 nt between every seeds, since the experiences shown in the article \cite{distance} demonstrated that a distance of 13 nt was less effective than a distance of 17 nt to enhance the repression of the gene expression level. \\
While no significant statistical differences was found for outer distance compare to the 17 nt distance, the distance use by the script is adjustable in the eventuality of new scientific evidences, using the -d option.

	\section{U-rich design}

        The microRNAs binding sites which perform the best are the ones with a local hight content of Adenine (A) and Uracile (U), over any other variable or predicator \cite{Urich}. This is probably correlated to binding site accessibility, and a low potential of forming a self-interacting secondary structure \cite{Urich}. \\ To take advantage of this two features, in order to improve the efficiency of the circular RNA sponge, the script design the sponge's sequence with as many U and A as possible. \\ That means that, outside the seed region, where a strict complementarity is required, or in the additional 3' pairing region (cf below), the sequence is write with U or A. \\ A cognate problem is that some proteins target and bind some AU rich sequence, known as AREs \cite{AREs}. However, since this AREs sequences contain some A \cite{AREs}, the safest option is to specify a U prior to an A when writing the sponge's sequence, when no other specific nucleotides is required for complementarity between the sponge and the microRNA. 

	\section{Binding site}

	The design of the microRNA' binding sites use the same features that the algorithms of microRNAs binding site prediction rely on. This features are presumably biologically relevant.\\
	 For example, Target Scan reward a A on the first position for scoring a potential microRNA's binding site\cite{Aanchor}, since this feature is evolutionary conserved among functionnal microRNA's binding site. This feature is used by the circular RNA design script to construct the binding sites, by putting a A in first position.
	
	The following rules are the one used by the circular RNA design script to write the sequence of a microRNA's binding site :
	\begin{itemize}
		\item a A is systematically put in first position of the binding site \cite{Aanchor}. 
		\item the seed (2-8nt) is a build by inserting complementary nucleotide to the microRNAs', forming an 8-mer site. See \cite{Urich, site} for further details and representation.
		\item a A is put in the ninth position \cite{Aanchor}.
		\item the 12th from 10th nucleotides are not complementary to the microRNAs' in order to avoid any Ago2 mediated cleavage of the circular RNA. This nucleotide are U, or A if not possible.
		\item the nucleotides from 13 to 16 (include, so four in total) are complementary to the \-microRNAs'.
		The reason is that Watson-Crick pairing to four contiguous nucleotides produce pairing in 3' and that most downregulation is associated to this pairing if it start at the 13th position \cite{site}.
		
	\end{itemize}

	\section{Clusters}
	The binding sites for one microRNA are organized in cluster by the design script, considering the observation that Ago2 shuttles between adjacent target and then that neighboring sites could cooperate to retain the Ago2-miRNA complex. \cite{cluster}.
	
	The cluster are wrote from 3' to 5' to make comparaision with microRNAs sequence easier. The clusters are the following :
